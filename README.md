### 🧠 Research & Projects

- 🧾 **Enhancing Commodity Factor Strategies with Deep Learning**  
  Applied LSTM and Transformer models to dynamically rank 19 commodity futures based on basis-momentum (BMOM), a hybrid factor combining momentum and term structure.

- 🧾 **Impact of Audit Reform on MD&A Tone and Performance Deviations**  
  Conducted a text mining analysis to quantify tone shifts in MD&A before and after Korea’s New External Audit Act. Used Difference-in-Differences methodology to show significant increases in abnormal tone post-reform, suggesting improved strategic language use and enhanced investor transparency.

- 🧾 **Experimental Design Using MINITAB: Cold-Temperature Adhesion Study**  
  Applied a 2⁷⁻³ fractional factorial DOE to analyze effects of phosphoric acid deoxidizer, neutralizer concentration/time, and adhesion promoters on aluminum bonding strength at –65°F. Identified significant factor interactions impacting low-temp peel strength.

- 🧾 **Volatility Prediction for Bitcoin using LSTM-GARCH Hybrid Model**  
  Integrated LSTM and GARCH models to jointly predict return and volatility of Bitcoin. Demonstrated improved forecasting accuracy under high volatility regimes.

- 🌱 **Impact Business Project: Coffee Grounds Upcycling**  
  Developed a solution to encourage coffee shops to participate in spent grounds collection through a subscription model and eco-friendly platform. The initiative aimed to raise public awareness of coffee waste as a recyclable resource.
- 🧪 **Steam R&E : Microbiome Analysis in Fermented Foods**  
  Investigated microbial diversity changes in Korean fermented foods (cheonggukjang, jeotgal, kimchi) across fermentation periods using 16S rRNA sequencing via Ion Torrent and Ion Reporter pipelines. Results showed pH/salinity-driven shifts in microbiome structures.  
- 🧪 **Frontier Chemistry: Lithium Extraction from Seawater**  
  Designed ion-exchange resins using plant-based cellulose to selectively absorb lithium ions from seawater. Compared Li absorption efficiency across different functional groups and bead formation conditions.
- 🧪 **STEAM R&E : Gill-Inspired Fine Dust Capture Device**  
  Designed a cross-step filtration system modeled after fish gill structures to capture fine dust in vehicle exhaust. Used SolidWorks and Flow Design to simulate fluid flow, and built a detachable .STL-based prototype optimized for safety and energy efficiency.
- 🧪 **Acoustic Phase Control for Directional Speakers (Physics)**  
  Developed a directional sound system using acoustic phase control. Applied MATLAB to optimize speaker array configurations and control signal origin with function generator input.

- 💻 **Q-Learning in Maze Navigation (Numerical Analysis Project)**  
  Explored the effect of discount factor (gamma) on Q-learning convergence when solving a maze. Analyzed exploration-exploitation tradeoffs using MATLAB; found minimal difference in convergence time on small maps.

- 📊 **Project Management Engineering – Seminar Presentation**  
  Delivered a presentation on *“Make Megaprojects More Modular”*, discussing modularization benefits in large-scale engineering projects.

- 💻 **OOP Projects – Game Development in Java**  
  Built generalized rock-paper-scissors game and a “catch-the-mouse” strategy game in Java as part of team assignments in object-oriented programming.

- 💻 **Time Series Forecasting: ARMA for Air Passenger Demand**  
  Forecasted monthly air passenger volume using ARMA modeling. Evaluated forecasting accuracy and seasonality components.

- 🤖 **Digital Literacy Startup Proposal using ChatGPT**  
  Proposed a digital literacy education service powered by ChatGPT. Designed curriculum frameworks targeting students and non-technical users.

- 💻 **P2P Loan Approval Prediction (SVM Model)**  
  Built a classification model using SVM to predict loan approval decisions based on borrower-level financial attributes from real-world P2P lending data.

- 💻 **Used Car Price Prediction (Ensemble Models)**  
  Applied Random Forest and AdaBoost regression to predict used car market prices. Preprocessed real-world listings and evaluated performance using RMSE.
